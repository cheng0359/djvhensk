        In this work, we identified three distinct enzyme candidates for targeted evolutionary engineering, with the objective of developing highly efficient PBAT-degrading enzymes that exhibit optimal catalytic activity under room temperature conditions. These enzyme candidates include <i>IsPETase</i>, a cutinase derived from the PET-degrading bacterium <i>Ideonella sakaiensis</i>; BsLipA, a lipase from <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>; and Lipase1028, which has been newly isolated in our laboratory. <i>IsPETase</i> is capable of degrading PET in the glassy state at moderate temperatures (30-37Â°C)<span class="references">[19-22]</span>. BsLipA exhibits good hydrolytic activity on ester bonds formed by medium-chain fatty acids<span class="references">[23, 24]</span>. Lipase1028 demonstrates significant degradation capabilities for polyurethanes (PU). Based on the structural similarities between the substrates of these three enzymes and PBAT, we propose that all three possess considerable evolutionary potential<span class="references">[3, 25]</span>.

        Furthermore, we also aim to obtain an engineering single strain capable of catabolizing of PBAT-derived degradation products. <i>Pseudomonas putida</i> has been recognized as a potential host organism for a diverse range of biotechnological applications, including the metabolic processing of plastics <span class="references">[26, 27]</span>. Wing-Jin Li et al. reported that the wild-type <i>Pseudomonas putida</i> KT2440 could degrade TPA but at a very slow rate, requiring over 50 hours to degrade 20 mM substrate<span class="references">[28]</span>. In this study, we transformed the gene cluster <i>tph</i> derived from <i>Pseudomonas stutzeri</i> TPA3 into KT2440 to enable its degradation of TPA<span class="references">[29, 30]</span>. Then, we performed adaptive laboratory evolution and metabolic engineering to isolate KT2440 variants capable of utilizing 1,4-butanediol as the sole carbon source. Ultimately, we will transform the evolved PBAT degradation enzyme genes which are obtained from directed evolution, into the engineered KT2440 strain, aiming to create a single strain capable of efficiently degrading PBAT and utilizing its degradation products, thus facilitating sustainable degradation processes eventually.
